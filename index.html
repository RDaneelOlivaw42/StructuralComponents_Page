           <p id = "topText">This includes the metal shafts or sticks which constitute the framework of the structure. The vertically placed shafts 
               (coloured white if they are in front, grey if they are in the back - in the simulated framework) are placed as vertices of 
               a rectangle/square. Horizontal shafts are placed as the “sides of the square”, bridging the “vertices”, i.e. the vertical 
               shafts. These (vertical) shafts are placed one on the top of another, connected by fillers. At the top and bottom of the 
               shafts, there are holes for nails. </p>

            <p id = "bottomText">Fillers are hollow metal tubes, which have holes for nails in them. When these fillers are placed on the shafts, these holes
                will correspond to the holes on the shafts. Nails shall be fixed through these holes to connect shafts together. The image 
                beside is an example of a filler. Fillers should be used instead of welding metal together because fillers can then be used to 
                increase the height of the structure easily and adding more levels. It also shortens the assembly process. </p>
